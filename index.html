							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>David Trinh is currently an E-Commerce Professional, specializing in Amazon Sales. In 2003, he graduated from DeVry University earning a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems. Upon graduating, David began helping his father build his small business and took a coding hiatus. The business thrived in the beginning stages but unfortunately fell victim to the bad economy and eventually had to shut down. After that, David vowed to get back into coding but struggled to find a way to be able to learn while maintaining a full-time job in the ever demanding world of E-Commerce. In comes Thinkful...</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h3>Thinkful</h3>
							<p>David chose Thinkful's Web Development Career Path, where they help beginners to become employed web developers. At Thinkful, they assign experienced engineers as mentors to students, and meet 3 times a week. Every week, David's mentor would help him understand difficult concepts, taught him best practices as well as providing real-time code reviews. The curriculum was framed around projects that emulate as real work and increase memory retention as they believe that learning occurs when students can make connections between new concepts and real experiences.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h3>Skills</h3>
							<p>David started with HTML and CSS, where he learned about responsive design and working with media queries while learning how to use the command line and navigate Git and Github. He then went on to learn about Javascript and instantly fell in love with the language and the many frameworks in the Javascript realm. Being able to manipulate data, such as using AJAX to retrieve information from APIs and displaying/manipulating its data, really intrigued David and developing his skills to be proficient in Javascript became his primary focus. He dove deep into the Angular JS framework and learned the significance of the Model View Controller (MVC) coding pattern. Here he developed a working knowledge of Angular's concepts and components such as: templating, two-way-data-binding, scope, modules, controllers and other many key concepts of Angular.</p>
